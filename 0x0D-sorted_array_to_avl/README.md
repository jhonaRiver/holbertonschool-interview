# 0x0D Array to AVL

> Challenge to build an AVL tree from an array

## Tasks

0. Write a function that builds an AVL tree from an array

    * Prototype: `avl_t *sorted_array_to_avl(int *array, size_t size);`
    * Where `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to be converted
    * And `size` is the number of element in the array
    * Your function must return a pointer to the root node of the created AVL tree, or `NULL` on failure
    * You can assume there will be no duplicate value in the array
    * You are not allowed to rotate
    * You can only have 3 functions in your file

# 0x11 Heap Sort

## Tasks

0. Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Heap sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort) algorithm

    * Prototype: `void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
    * You must implement the `sift-down` heap sort algorithm
    * Youâ€™re expected to print the `array` after each time you swap two elements

1. Write in the file `0-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Heap sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

    * in the best case
    * in the average case
    * in the worst case
